# Project_Elective_Sem6
Bangalore Air Pollution Susceptibility Maps

## Part 1: Setting up the Dataset, Colab Notebook and training the ML model

- `PE.ipynb` contains the code for the project
- `Drive` folder is the folder which contains all the raster files downloaded from GEE
- `dataset.csv` denotes the final dataset we obtained and trained the model on.

## Part 2: Creating a web-app to visualize and interact with the data
We will be using streamlit to build this application.
### Setup
1. Install streamlit on your system. Some of the dependent libraries that streamlit uses have outdated tools so please check which version works with all the other python libraries it uses.
