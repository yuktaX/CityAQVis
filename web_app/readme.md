## Setup
1. Install streamlit on your system. Some of the dependent libraries that streamlit uses have outdated tools so please check which version works with all the other python libraries it uses. This is mentioned in `requirements.txt`
2. Clone `webapp` locally and in the terminal run `streamlit run app.py`
